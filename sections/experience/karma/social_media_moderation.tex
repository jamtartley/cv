\item Moderation system for social media comment overlays:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allowed user to moderate streams of comments from Facebook, YouTube and Twitter posts
    \item Comments were retrieved using the API of each social media platform
    \item They were converted into a single data structure and inserted into a sharded database on mLab
    \item A moderator could choose comments to be promoted so that they were available as JSON objects by querying the app's API
    \item The on-air graphics software (CharacterWorks) could then display them over the live feed in real time
    \item Chat show presenters have a tablet displaying them so that they could read them to their guests
    \item The moderation panel was rebranded for each different client
\end{itemize}
