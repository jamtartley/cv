\item SHEL - toy interpreted programming language
\begin{itemize}
    \item Written in C++11
    \item Lexer scans input source files and breaks them into tokens
    \item Parser builds an abstract syntax tree from the tokens and calls out to the logger if there are parse errors
    \item Interpreter evaluates the syntax tree and performs calculations/loops/conditions etc.
    \item Tiny SHEL library is provided for accessing/mutating arrays, printing output and calling native functions
\end{itemize}
