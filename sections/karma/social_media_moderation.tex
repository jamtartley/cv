\item Moderation system for social media comment overlays:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allowed user to moderate streams of comments from Facebook posts, YouTube videos and Twitter posts
    \item Comments were retrieved using the API of each social media platform
    \item They were then converted into a unifying data structure and inserted into a highly available sharded database (mLab)
    \item A moderator could choose comments to be promoted so that they were available as JSON objects by querying the app's API
    \item The on-air graphics software (CharacterWorks) could then display them over the live feed in real time
    \item Chat show presenters have a tablet displaying them so that they could read them to their guests
    \item The presentation layer was cleanly separated so that the moderation panel could quickly be rebranded per client
\end{itemize}
